/**
 * Records BOTH sides of a VoIP call (WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram / …), which the telephony capture
 * paths cannot reach because there is no carrier call involved.
 *
 * Two independent streams are combined:
 *  - **far party** — [VoipAudioPolicy]'s loopback-render sink, a duplicate of the remote voice the app
 *    is rendering. The policy must already be armed (see that class); the sink may be created after
 *    the call has started.
 *  - **near party** — a plain `MIC` capture. The source matters: `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` is zero-filled
 *    for the whole call, because the in-call policy silences a record client that cannot bypass it and
 *    that source is the very one the VoIP app itself holds. `MIC` is not silenced, and the VoIP app
 *    keeps working alongside it.
 *
 * The two are interleaved to stereo — LEFT near, RIGHT far — and then downmixed to mono for the
 * encoder, matching what [DirectAudioRecorderSession] does for a stereo carrier capture, so recordings
 * from both paths sound alike.
 *
 * Because the streams are separate free-running `AudioRecord`s, the muxer pairs them by the real
 * time their audio was captured ([SlotPairer]): the file is a run of 20 ms slots, each side fills
 * the slot its chunk belongs to, silence fills a gap, and neither side can push the other along.
 * Until 2.4.2 it paired BY ARRIVAL — one chunk from each queue per loop — which consumed the far
 * queue at the near side's pace; on a Galaxy S21 Ultra where the mic was re-taken 155 times in two
 * minutes (issue #41) the far party ended 6.4 s late. [VoipSyncLedger] measures the offset and
 * counts every loss (docs/dev-notes/2026-09-22-voip-sync-instrumentation.md).
