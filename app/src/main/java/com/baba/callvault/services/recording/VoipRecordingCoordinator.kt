/**
 * Turns "a VoIP call started/ended" into a recording, writing into the same folder as carrier
 * recordings so both appear together in the app.
 *
 * Naming differs from the carrier path out of necessity: a VoIP call leaves no call-log entry and
 * exposes no phone number, so there is no contact to resolve. Recordings are therefore named by time
 * and marked `voip`, which is honest about what we know rather than guessing at who was on the call.
 *
 * Kept deliberately small and independent of [AudioRecordingEngine]: that engine is built around a
 * carrier call's metadata (number, direction, ignore-rules), none of which exists here.
