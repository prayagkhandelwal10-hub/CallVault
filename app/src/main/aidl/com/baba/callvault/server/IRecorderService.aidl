/**
 * CallVault Plan 5 — PRODUCTION recorder command channel.
 *
 * Implemented by the detached, privileged shell-uid recorder daemon
 * ([com.baba.callvault.server.RecorderServer]) and called BY THE APP over a raw binder
 * (no ADB), even while Wireless debugging is OFF. The daemon runs scrcpy-server + the muxer; the APP
 * owns metadata (SAF filename, call-log lookups) and merely hands the daemon a writable output fd.
 *
 * KISS simplification vs the Plan 5 draft signature: recording metadata stays APP-side, so the
 * interface only carries what the daemon needs (source/codec/bitRate + the output fd). The app names
 * the SAF file and performs call-log lookups itself, exactly as
 * [com.baba.callvault.services.recording.AudioRecordingEngine] does today.
 *
 * Mirrors Shizuku's IShizukuService command-channel pattern.
