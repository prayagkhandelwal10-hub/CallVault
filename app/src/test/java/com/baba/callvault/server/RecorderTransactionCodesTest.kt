/**
 * Guards the binder wire between the app and the daemon.
 *
 * `IRecorderService.aidl` declares no explicit transaction IDs, so every method's ID is its **position**
 * in the file. Adding a method anywhere but the end, or reordering two, silently renumbers the rest —
 * and a daemon left running by the previous version would then answer the wrong call for every
 * transaction after the edit. Nothing about that failure looks like a numbering problem from the app.
 *
 * So the numbering is asserted here. A failure means "you moved a method", and the fix is to put it
 * back and append instead.
